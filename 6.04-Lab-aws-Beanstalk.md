# Lab: Deploying a Web App with AWS Elastic Beanstalk


---

## Prerequisites

- AWS account (with IAM permissions for Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, S3)
- Region: us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
- Browser with pop-ups enabled

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Application Package

1. **Get a sample app:**  
   Download a sample Tomcat app zip:  
   [tomcat.zip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/samples/tomcat.zip)

---

## Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket (Optional)

Elastic Beanstalk uploads your application file to S3.  
You can let Beanstalk create and manage this, or create your own bucket if you want custom control.

- Console: S3 > Create bucket > Name: `my-eb-apps-bucket` > all defaults OK.

---

## Step 3: Create a New Elastic Beanstalk Application

1. In AWS Console, search for **Elastic Beanstalk** and open it.
2. Click **Create application**.
3. **Application name:**  
   E.g., `my-elastic-beanstalk-app`
4. **Platform:**  
   - Platform: `Tomcat`
   - Platform branch: Latest available
   - Platform version: Latest
5. **Application code:**  
   - Select "Upload your code"
   - Click "Choose file" and select `tomcat.zip`
6. **Environment:**  
   - Environment name: e.g., `my-eb-env`
   - Domain: auto-generated, or customize if you wish

---

## Step 4: Configure Environment (Optional/Advanced)

- **Instance type:** t2.micro (free tier eligible)
- **Capacity:** Min 2, Max 6 (default: 2)
- **Load Balancer:** Application Load Balancer (default)
- **Rolling updates:** Leave default or adjust as needed
- **Database:** Leave "None" for this lab

**Advanced configuration:**  
- Click "Configure more options" to set security group, VPC, scaling, etc.
- For this lab, defaults are fine.

---

## Step 5: Launch the Environment

1. Click **Create environment** to deploy.
2. Wait several minutes for AWS to provision infrastructure (EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, Security Group).
3. Once complete, health should be **Ok**.

---

## Step 6: Test and Verify

1. Click the **environment URL** (ends in `elasticbeanstalk.com`).
2. You should see the sample application page.

---

## Step 7: Explore Underlying AWS Resources

1. **EC2:**  
   - Console > EC2 > Instances: Find two instances named for your environment.
2. **Load Balancer:**  
   - EC2 > Load Balancers: An ALB is created for traffic distribution.
3. **Auto Scaling Group:**  
   - EC2 > Auto Scaling Groups: Manages instance count.
4. **Security Group:**  
   - Allows HTTP (port 80) from anywhere.
5. **S3 Bucket:**  
   - Stores application version uploads.

---

## Step 8: Monitor and Manage

- In Beanstalk, use the **Monitoring** tab for metrics.
- Use **Configuration** to modify scaling, instance type, or environment variables.

---

## Step 9: Update Your Application (Optional)

1. Make changes to your application code.
2. Zip and upload a new version:
   - Beanstalk > Environment > Upload and Deploy

---

## Step 10: Clean Up

1. **Terminate the Beanstalk environment:**
   - Actions > Terminate environment (removes all associated AWS resources).
2. **(Optional) Delete S3 buckets** if you created custom ones.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                    | Possible Cause                 | Solution                                  |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 404/503 after deploy       | App deploy not complete        | Wait for health status "Ok"               |
| Cannot access app          | Security group/firewall issue  | Ensure port 80 is open in security group  |
| Deploy fails               | Incorrect zip format           | Zip app files properly, not a folder      |
