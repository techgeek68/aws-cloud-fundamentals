**Fundamentals of Pricing**

**AWS Pricing Model**
  - There are three fundamental drivers of AWS cost:
    - **Compute:**
      - Billed per hour or per second (per-second for many Linux instances).
      - Price varies by instance family/size, region, tenancy, architecture, and purchase option.
    
    - **Storage:**
      - Typically billed per GB; some services also charge for requests, throughput, retrievals, or provisioning (e.g., IOPS).
    
    - **Data Transfer:**
      - Outbound data is charged; inbound is generally free (with exceptions).
      - Charges vary by direction (internet, inter-AZ, inter-region) and service; often tiered per GB.
    
**How do you pay for AWS?**
  - **Pay for what you use:**
    - Consumption based pricing with no large upfront capital expense. Turn services off, and you stop paying.
  - **Pay less when you reserve:**
    - Reserved Instances (RIs) can save up to ~75% vs. On-Demand when committing for 1-3 years.
      - **All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI):** Largest effective discount.
      - **Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI):** Medium discount.
      - **No Upfront Reserved Instance (NURI):** Lowest discount; pay over term.

  > Note: Savings Plans offer similar savings with more flexibility for computing.

  - **Pay less by using more:**
    - Tiered/volume discounts (e.g., Amazon S3, EBS, EFS) reduce per‑GB rates as usage grows.
      
  - **Pay even less as AWS grows:**
    - AWS passes economies of scale to customers; since 2006, AWS has reduced prices dozens of times (over 75).
    
  - **Custom pricing:**
    - Private (Enterprise or specialised) pricing for high volume workloads may qualify for private pricing agreements.

**AWS Free Tier and No-Charge Services**

**AWS Free Tier**
  - The Free Tier lets new customers gain hands-on experience with AWS services free for one year.

**Services with no charge**
Some AWS services have no direct charge:
  - Amazon VPC
  - Elastic Beanstalk**
  - Auto Scaling**
  - AWS CloudFormation**
  - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

> Note: You may incur charges for other AWS services and resources used in conjunction with these (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 storage, data transfer).


---


**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**

**On-premises vs. Cloud**
  - Traditional infrastructure requires significant resources and administration, with contracts, upfront costs, and slow scaling.
  - With AWS Cloud, there are no upfront expenses for most services, self-service provisioning, and elastic scaling up/down with pay-as-you-go pricing.


**What is TCO?**
  - Total Cost of Ownership estimates the full direct and indirect costs of running a system. Use TCO to:
    - Compare on‑premises vs. AWS costs
    - Budget and justify cloud migration and modernisation
  

**TCO Considerations**
  1. Server costs:
       - servers, racks, PDUs, switches; OS/licenses; maintenance/support
  3. Storage costs:
       - disks/arrays, SAN/FC switches, backup, administration
  5. Network costs:
       - LAN switches, bandwidth, load balancers, firewalls, and administration
  7. IT labour costs:
       - server, storage, network, security, and platform administration
  9. Facilities:
       - space, power, cooling

Optional to include: compliance/audit, DR (Disaster Recovery) / BCP (Business Continuity Planning), security tooling, procurement/finance overhead, and idle capacity risk.


**On-premises vs. All-in-Cloud Savings**

| Model         | Upfront Cost | Monthly Cost | Scalability | Risk of Overprovisioning |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| On-Premises   | $30,000     | $2,000       | Low         | High                      |
| Cloud         | $0          | $2,000       | High        | Low                       |

  - Important: Actual results vary by workload, region, architecture, and usage patterns.

**AWS Organisations**

**Introduction**
  - AWS Organisations lets you centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts. It provides:
    - Policy-based controls (Service Control Policies)
    - Logical grouping via Organisational Units (OUs)
    - Programmatic automation (API/CLI/SDK)
    - Consolidated billing and cost visibility

Using a multi-account strategy improves isolation, blast-radius reduction, regulatory alignment, and cost tracking.


**Key Features & Benefits**
  - Account vending and lifecycle automation (e.g., via Account Factory / Control Tower)
  - Hierarchical organisational structure with nested OUs
  - Centralised management of guardrails (SCPs), tagging policies, backup policies, and AI service opt-outs
  - Consolidated billing with payer (management) account and linked member accounts
  - Delegated administrator capability for selected AWS services (e.g., AWS Config, Detective, GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudTrail Lake)
  - Integration with AWS CloudTrail for centralised audit
  - Enables least-privilege governance patterns at scale


**Security with AWS Organisations**
  - IAM Policies (inside each account):
    - Grant/deny permissions for principals (users, roles, groups)
  - Service Control Policies (SCPs) (organisation level):
    - Set the maximum available permission *ceiling* for accounts or OUs. They do not grant permissions by themselves; IAM must still allow.
   > - Deny unapproved regions, restrict use of root user, block certain services, and enforce condition keys
  - Tag Policies:
    - Enforce consistent tagging schema (names and capitalisation)
  - Backup Policies:
    - Standardise backup plan application across accounts
  - AI Services Opt-Out Policies:
    - Centralise opt-out for AI data usage


> Note: Opt-Out - An instance of choosing not to participate in something.


**Organisations Setup**
  1. Create an Organisation (establish management/payer account)
  2. Define high-level OU structure (e.g., Security, Infrastructure, Sandbox, Workloads, Prod vs. NonProd)
  3. Attach baseline SCPs (e.g., deny root actions, restrict regions)
  4. Provision accounts (manual, Control Tower, or custom automation)
  5. Delegate service administrators (e.g., Security Hub in Security OU)
  6. Apply tagging/backup / AI opt-out policies where needed
  7. Test restrictions (attempt disallowed actions; validate CloudTrail logging)
  8. Monitor and evolve governance (add anomaly detection, refine OUs)


**Accessing AWS Organisations**
  - AWS Management Console
  - AWS CLI (`aws organisations...`)
  - SDKs (Boto3, etc.)
  - HTTPS Query APIs
  - Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation custom resources, Terraform, Cs

**Sample Exam Question**

**Which AWS service provides infrastructure security optimisation recommendations?**

| Choice | Response |
|--------|----------|
| A | AWS Price List Application Programming Interface (API) |
| B | Reserved Instances |
| C | AWS Trusted Advisor |
| D | Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet |

**Answer:**  
The correct answer is **C**.  
The keyword in question is "recommendations".

Explanation:
  - AWS Trusted Advisor runs automated checks and supplies actionable recommendations—including security hardening (e.g., MFA on root, exposed access keys).
  - Price List API supplies pricing metadata, not optimisation guidance.
  - Reserved Instances are a pricing mechanism; no security recommendations.
  - EC2 Spot Fleet manages Spot capacity; does not audit or advise on security posture.

Exam Tip:
When you see "recommendations" + "security" or "cost optimisation" across multiple AWS services in a single question, Trusted Advisor is a strong candidate.
