## AWS Global Infrastructure Overview

---
**AWS Global Infrastructure**

**What is AWS Global Infrastructure?**
  - AWS Global Infrastructure is engineered for elastic scale, resiliency, security, performance, and low-latency global reach. It comprises Regions, Availability Zones (AZs), and a global edge network (Points of Presence).
  - Reference Links:
    - [Global Infrastructure Map](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/#AWS_Global_Infrastructure_Map)
    - [Regions & Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)
    - [Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)


**AWS Regions**
  - A Region is a distinct geographic area containing multiple, physically separated Availability Zones.
  - Regions are isolated for fault containment and compliance boundaries; data does not move between Regions unless you configure it (e.g., replication, backups).
  - Inter-Region communication leverages AWS’s private backbone network for predictable performance.
  - Not all services launch in every Region immediately—service availability can influence Region choice.

**Selection Factors (CLASs):**
  - **C**ompliance & data governance (regulations, residency requirements)
  - **L**atency to end users
  - **A**vailable services/features (e.g., specific ML chips, Local Zones, Outposts support)
  - **S**pend (pricing variations by Region)


**Availability Zones**
  - Each Region has multiple AZs (≥ 3 in most mature Regions).
  - An AZ consists of one or more discrete data centres with independent power, cooling, and physical security.
  - High-bandwidth, low-latency networking between AZs (typically single-digit ms round-trip).
  - Design principle: Spread tiers/replicas across ≥ 2 AZs for high availability (HA) and fault tolerance.

**AWS Data Centres**
  - Purpose-built for security & resilience (redundant power feeds, UPS, generators, diverse fibre paths).
  - Each data centre can host tens of thousands of servers (approx. 50K–80K physical servers, evolving).
  - Physical security: multi-layered (perimeter, cameras, access badges, biometrics, mantraps, auditing).

**Points of Presence (PoPs)**
  - Include Edge Locations (for Amazon CloudFront, Shield, AWS Global Accelerator) and Regional Edge Caches.
  - Reduce latency via content caching, TLS termination, and acceleration services.
  - Work with services like CloudFront, Route 53 (authoritative DNS), and AWS Global Accelerator (traffic steering).


**Regions vs. AZs vs. Edge Locations (Comparison)**
| Aspect | Region | Availability Zone | Edge Location |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Purpose | Geographic isolation & compliance boundary | Fault isolation & HA within Region | Low-latency content & network optimization |
| Composition | Set of AZs | One or more data centers | Small data center / caching node |
| Typical Use | Deploy multi-AZ apps, DR strategies across Regions | Distribute replicas, failover domains | CDN (CloudFront), DNS, DDoS absorption |
| Data Movement | Explicit (replication or copy) | Automatic (service-managed, e.g., S3) | Primarily cache; origin pull when needed |
| Latency | Inter-Region higher | Inter-AZ low | Last-mile minimized |

> Note: Architect first for multi-AZ resilience, then multi-Region for disaster recovery / regulatory / latency segmentation.



**Infrastructure Characteristics**
  - Elasticity: Scale horizontally/vertically on demand.
  - Scalability: Global footprint expands continuously.
  - Fault Tolerance: Multi-AZ architecture, automated failover patterns (RDS Multi-AZ, EFS, S3 replication).
  - High Availability: SLA-backed services leverage redundancy (e.g., S3 across ≥ 3 AZs).
  - Global Reach: Dozens of Regions, edge presence in hundreds of cities (check map for current counts).
