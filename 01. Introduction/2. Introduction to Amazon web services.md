# Introduction to Amazon Web Services(AWS)

---

**What are Web Services?**
  - Software applications accessible over the internet, interoperable across platforms.
  - Use standardized formats (XML/JSON) for data exchange.
  - Operate through APIs (rules for software interaction).


**What is AWS?**
  - Secure cloud platform offering a broad set of global cloud-based products
  - On-demand access to compute, storage, network, database, and management tools.
  - Pay only for what you use; services work together like building blocks.

---

**Interacting with AWS**
  1. **AWS Management Console:** Graphical interface.
  2. **Command Line Interface (AWS CLI):** Commands or scripts.
  3. **Software Development Kits (SDKs):** Code integration (Java, Python, etc.).

---

**AWS Global Infrastructure**
- Designed for flexibility, reliability, scalability, and security.
  
  - **Global Infrastructure Map:** [AWS Global Infrastructure Map](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/#AWS_Global_Infrastructure_Map)
  
  - **Regions and Availability Zones:** [Regions & AZs](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)

**AWS Regions**
  - Geographical areas with AWS data centers.
  - Full redundancy and connectivity.
  - Each region has multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

**AWS Data Centers**
  - Secure, redundant power, networking, connectivity.
  - 50k-80k physical servers per center.

**Choosing an AWS Region**
  - Data governance/legal requirements
  - Proximity to customers (latency)
  - Service availability
  - Costs

**AWS Points of Presence (PoPs)**
  - **Edge Locations:** Serve cached content (CloudFront CDN)
  - **Regional Edge Caches:** For less frequently accessed content

---

**AWS Infrastructure Features**

- **Elasticity:** Dynamically adjusts capacity.
- **Scalability:** Grows with demand.
- **Fault-tolerance:** No single point of failure.
- **High availability:** Minimizes downtime.


**Regions vs Availability Zones vs Edge Locations**

| Type             | Description                                                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Regions          | Virtual geographic areas with multiple availability zones. Geographic redundancy.        |
| Availability Zones | Separate clusters for fault tolerance and high availability. Host servers, apps, etc.   |
| Edge Locations   | Small data centers for caching and content delivery close to users.                     |

*   **Availability Zones (AZs):** One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity within a Region.
*   **Edge Locations / Points of Presence:** Sites used by CloudFront and Route 53 to cache content and reduce latency for end-users.


**Categorization of AWS Services**

**2. Foundation Services (Core Compute, Storage & Networking)**
The fundamental building blocks for any cloud workload.
*   **Compute**
    *   **EC2:** Scalable virtual servers.
    *   **Lambda:** Serverless functions (run code in response to events).
*   **Storage**
    *   **S3:** Highly durable and scalable object storage.
    *   **EBS:** High-performance block storage volumes for EC2.
    *   **Glacier/S3 Glacier:** Low-cost, long-term archive storage.
*   **Networking & Content Delivery**
    *   **VPC:** Isolated virtual network for your AWS resources.
    *   **Route 53:** Scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS).
    *   **CloudFront:** Global Content Delivery Network (CDN).

**3. Platform & Application Development Services**
Managed services for building, deploying, and managing applications.

| Category | Key Services & Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | **RDS** (Managed Relational), **DynamoDB** (Managed NoSQL) |
| **Analytics** | **Redshift** (Cloud Data Warehousing), **Kinesis** (Real-time Data Streaming), **Glue** (Serverless ETL) |
| **Application Integration** | **SQS** (Message Queuing), **SNS** (Pub/Notif.), **Step Functions** (Workflow Orchestration) |
| **Deployment & Management** | **CloudFormation** (Infrastructure as Code), **CodePipeline** (CI/CD), **CloudWatch** (Monitoring) |
| **Containers** | **ECS/EKS** (Container Management) |
| **Security & Identity** | **Cognito** (User Identity & Access Management for apps) |
| **Mobile & Web** | **Pinpoint** (User Engagement & Notifications) |
| **Media Services** | **MediaConvert** (File-based Video Transcoding) |
| **Caching** | **ElastiCache** (In-memory data store for caching) |
| **End-User Computing** | **AppStream 2.0** (Secure Application Streaming) |

**4. Application Services**
Services directly consumed by end-users for specific tasks.
*   **Amazon WorkSpaces:** Fully managed, secure Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).
*   **Amazon Chime:** Unified communications service for online meetings and video conferencing.
