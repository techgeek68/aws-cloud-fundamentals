# Introduction to Amazon Web Services(AWS)

---

**What are Web Services?**
  - Software applications accessible over the internet, interoperable across platforms.
  - Use standardised formats (XML/JSON) for data exchange.
  - Operate through APIs (rules for software interaction).


**What is AWS?**
  - Secure cloud platform offering a broad set of global cloud-based products
  - On-demand access to compute, storage, network, database, and management tools.
  - Pay only for what you use; services work together like building blocks.

**Interacting with AWS**
  1. **AWS Management Console:** Graphical interface.
  2. **Command Line Interface (AWS CLI):** Commands or scripts.
  3. **Software Development Kits (SDKs):** Code integration (Java, Python, etc.).

**AWS Well-Architected Framework**
- Helps architects build secure, performant, resilient, and efficient infrastructure. Six pillars:
  1. **Security:** Protect data, systems, assets; compliance & risk management.
   - *Example:* Use CloudTrail for logging.
  2. **Operational Excellence:** Manage/monitor operations, improve processes.
   - *Example:* Use CodeCommit for version control.
  3. **Reliability:** Recover from failures, maintain performance.
   - *Example:* Multi-AZ RDS deployments.
  4. **Performance Efficiency:** Optimise resources, adapt to change.
   - *Example:* Use Lambda for serverless.
  5. **Cost Optimisation:** Avoid unnecessary costs, maximise ROI.
   - *Example:* S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
  6. **Sustainability:** Environmentally responsible architecture.
   - *Example:* EC2 Auto Scaling.

**General Design Principles**
  - **Stop guessing capacity:** Scale automatically.
  - **Test at production scale:** Create test envs on demand.
  - **Automate:** Create/replicate workloads efficiently.
  - **Evolutionary architectures:** Design for change.
  - **Data-driven architecture:** Use data for improvement.
  - **Game days:** Simulate events to improve resilience.
