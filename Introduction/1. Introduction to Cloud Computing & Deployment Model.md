**Traditional Computing Model vs Cloud Computing Model**

**Traditional Computing**
- Hardware solutions require physical space, staff, security, planning, and capital expenditure.
- Long hardware procurement cycles.
- Capacity provisioned by guessing maximum peaks.

**Cloud Computing**
- Infrastructure as software.
- Flexible, cost-effective, easily changed.
- Eliminates undifferentiated heavy-lifting tasks.


**Similarities between AWS & Traditional IT**
| Category      | On-premises IT                | AWS Equivalent                      |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Security      | Firewalls, ACLs, Admins       | Security Groups, Network ACLs, IAM  |
| Networking    | Routers, Switches             | ELB, VPC                            |
| Compute       | Physical servers              | EC2 Instances, AMI                  |
| Storage/DB    | DAS, SAN, NAS, RDBMS          | EBS, EFS, S3, RDS                   |


**Traditional IT**
  - **CapEx:** Requires upfront investment in servers, storage, and networking.
  - **OpEx:** Ongoing costs for electricity, cooling, maintenance, and upgrades.

**Cloud**
  - **OpEx:** Pay only for what you use, no hardware investments.
  - **Scalability:** Easily increase/decrease resources.
  - **Elasticity:** No need to over-provision for peak loads.

**CapEx vs. OpEx**
| Model         | CapEx         | OpEx        |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| On-Premises   | Yes           | Yes         |
| Cloud         | No            | Yes         |


**Example Calculation**
| Model         | Upfront Cost | Monthly Cost | Scalability | Risk of Overprovisioning |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| On-Premises   | $50,000     | $2,000       | Low         | High                    |
| Cloud         | $0          | $2,000       | High        | Low                     |

- Private Cloud Setup Example
  - Deploy OpenStack on dedicated hardware.
  - Create virtual networks, storage pools.
  - Full control over security and compliance.

3. Hybrid Cloud
- Combination of public and private clouds, flexible, secure, cost-effective.
