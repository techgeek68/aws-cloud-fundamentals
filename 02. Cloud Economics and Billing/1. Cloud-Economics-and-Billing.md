# Cloud Economics and Billing

**Fundamentals of Pricing**

**AWS Pricing Model**
There are three fundamental drivers of AWS cost:
  - **Compute:**
    - Billed per hour or per second (per-second for many Linux instances).
    - Price varies by instance family/size, region, tenancy, architecture, and purchase option.
    
  - **Storage:**
    - Typically billed per GB; some services also charge for requests, throughput, retrievals, or provisioning (e.g., IOPS).
    
  - **Data Transfer:**
    - Outbound data is charged; inbound is generally free (with exceptions).
    - Charges vary by direction (internet, inter-AZ, inter-region) and service; often tiered per GB.
    
**How do you pay for AWS?**
  - **Pay for what you use:**
    - Consumption based pricing with no large upfront capital expense. Turn services off, and you stop paying.
  - **Pay less when you reserve:**
    - Reserved Instances (RIs) can save up to ~75% vs. On-Demand when committing for 1–3 years.
      - **All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI):** Largest effective discount.
      - **Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI):** Medium discount.
      - **No Upfront Reserved Instance (NURI):** Lowest discount; pay over term.

  > Note: Savings Plans offer similar savings with more flexibility for computing.

  - **Pay less by using more:**
    - Tiered/volume discounts (e.g., Amazon S3, EBS, EFS) reduce per‑GB rates as usage grows.
  - **Pay even less as AWS grows:** AWS passes economies of scale to customers; since 2006, AWS has reduced prices dozens of times (over 75).
  - **Custom pricing:** Private (Enterprise or specialized) pricing for high volume workloads may qualify for private pricing agreements.

**AWS Free Tier and No-Charge Services**

**AWS Free Tier**
  - The Free Tier lets new customers gain hands-on experience with AWS services free for one year.

**Services with no charge**
Some AWS services have no direct charge:
  - Amazon VPC
  - Elastic Beanstalk**
  - Auto Scaling**
  - AWS CloudFormation**
  - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

> Note: You may incur charges for other AWS services and resources used in conjunction with these (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 storage, data transfer).

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**

**On-premises vs. Cloud**

Traditional infrastructure requires significant resources and administration, with contracts, upfront costs, and slow scaling. 
With AWS Cloud, there's no upfront expense for most services, self-service provisioning, and elastic scale up/down with pay-as-you-go.


**What is TCO?**
Total Cost of Ownership estimates the full direct and indirect costs of running a system. Use TCO to:
  - Compare on‑premises vs. AWS costs
  - Budget and justify cloud migration and modernization
  

**TCO Considerations**
  1. Server costs: servers, racks, PDUs, switches; OS/licenses; maintenance/support
  2. Storage costs: disks/arrays, SAN/FC switches, backup, administration
  3. Network costs: LAN switches, bandwidth, load balancers, firewalls, and administration
  4. IT labor costs: server, storage, network, security, and platform administration
  5. Facilities: space, power, cooling

Optional to include: compliance/audit, DR (Disaster Recovery) / BCP (Business Continuity Planning), security tooling, procurement/finance overhead, and idle capacity risk.


**On-premises vs. All-in-Cloud Savings**

| Model         | Upfront Cost | Monthly Cost | Scalability | Risk of Overprovisioning |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| On-Premises   | $30,000     | $2,000       | Low         | High                      |
| Cloud         | $0          | $2,000       | High        | Low                       |

  - Important: Actual results vary by workload, region, architecture, and usage patterns.

**AWS Pricing Calculator**
Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to:
  - Estimate monthly costs and model solutions before building
  - Explore instance types, purchase options, and contract terms
  - Identify cost reduction levers (e.g., Reserved Instances, Savings Plans)
  - Name, group, and share estimates for review

**Reading an estimate**
  - First 12 months total
  - Total upfront
  - Total monthly

**Additional Benefit Considerations**

Hard benefits
  - Lower spend on compute, storage, networking, and security services
  - Reduced hardware/software purchases (capex)
  - Lower operations, backup, and disaster recovery costs
  - Fewer operations personnel required for undifferentiated work

Soft benefits
  - Reusable services and platforms enable faster, flexible solutions
  - Increased developer productivity
  - Improved customer satisfaction
  - Business agility to pursue new opportunities
  - Greater global reach with multiple regions

**Case Study: TCO**

Background
  - Global company with 200+ locations
  - 500 million customers, $3 billion annual revenue

Challenge
  - Rapidly deploy new solutions
  - Upgrade aging equipment

Criteria
  - Broad solution for all workloads
  - Modify processes to increase efficiency and reduce cost
  - Eliminate repetitive tasks (e.g., patching)
  - Achieve positive ROI

Solution
  - Migrated on-premises data center to AWS
  - Eliminated 205 servers (~90%)
  - Moved almost all applications to AWS
  - Adopted 3-year EC2 Reserved Instances

Results
  - Improved growth and operational efficiency
  - Optimized resources with robust security
  - Enhanced disaster recovery and compute capacity
  - Faster speed to market: provision businesses in a day; deploy services in minutes
  - Ongoing cost optimization
